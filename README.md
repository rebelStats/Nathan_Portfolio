# [Project 1 : Data Science Salary Scarping and Cleaning](https://github.com/rebelStats/ds_sal)
* Built a scraper using Seleium to scrape hundreds of job postings from Glassdoor.com
* Glassdoor updates their site frequently so it may not run anymore (data scraped in summer 2021)
* Data was gathered from different cities in the US using the Glassdoor search engine
* Data was cleaned and too few useful oberservations were gathered to create any models
